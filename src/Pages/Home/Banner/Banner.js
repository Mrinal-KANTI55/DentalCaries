                        <p>images of your teeth that your dentist uses to evaluate your oral health. These X-rays are used with low levels of radiation to capture images of the interior of your teeth and gums. This can help your dentist to identify problems, like cavities, tooth decay, and impacted teeth.</p>

Most people find that it is valuable to have a checkup at least every six months, so our dentist can:

                            Check for problems that you might not see or feel
                            Find early signs of decay
                            Treat oral health problems early, while they are still manageable
                            Regular checkups include a thorough cleaning, polishing, and an oral exam by the doctor. During the oral exam, our dentist checks the health of your mouth, teeth, gums, cheeks, and tongue. At each visit, our dentist also checks old fillings and restorations because constant pressure from chewing, grinding, or clenching can cause them to wear away, chip, or crack.</span> </h3>
